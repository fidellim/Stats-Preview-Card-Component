![Solution - Mobile]("./images/Solution%20Mobile.png")
![Solution - PC]("./images/Solution%20PC.png")
Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

	background: linear-gradient(rgba(90, 1, 142, 0.45), rgba(90, 1, 142, 0.45)),
		url(./images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
}
```
